Numbers round solver new methodology idea
take 2 numbers then do an operation to them, then perform an other operation to the result and another number, repeat.
This removes the need for brackets as you can just change the ordering of the operations occurring.

Permutate starting operands and then for each operatoion that is not [word for order dependent], iterate for each order

Requires complete logical rewrite (AGAIN).
