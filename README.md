Creating a program to solve the popular British TV show "Countdown". I am using the wordlist from dwyl/english-words as a source. However it incudes words that are not allowed in Countdown, including names. Therefore I made it output several options for the words incase this occurs. I appreciate the program is inneficient, however I am a beginner to C#. Therefore I have made thinking display on the screen to show the program is still running. I hope the instructions in the console output are descriptive enough.
