I AM INEXPERIENCED IN PROGRAMMING AND A BEGINNER TO C#, so forgive me for the inefficiencies in my code.

I have created a program to solve the words round from the popular British TV show "Countdown". I am using the wordlist from the repo /dwyl/english-words as a source. However, it incudes words that are not allowed in Countdown, including names. Therefore, I made it output several options for the words in case this occurs. I appreciate the program is inefficient, however I am a beginner to C#. Therefore, I have made thinking display on the screen to show the program is still running. I hope the instructions in the console output are descriptive enough.
